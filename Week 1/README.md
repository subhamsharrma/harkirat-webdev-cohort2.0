# 🚀 Week 1 Project: Zerodha Homepage Clone (HTML + CSS)

As part of my Week 1 progress in my frontend development journey, I built a basic **Zerodha landing page clone** using only **HTML and CSS**.

### ✅ Features Implemented:
- Responsive **navigation bar** using Flexbox
- Zerodha **logo + header navigation** (Signup, About, Products, Pricing, Supports)
- Centered **hero image** from official Zerodha site
- Clean and minimal **typography section**: main heading & subheading
- Clickable **"Sign up for free" button** (currently links to Google for testing)

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Structure and semantics of HTML5
- CSS Flexbox for layout management
- Basic responsive design practices
- Styling buttons, aligning sections
- How to connect buttons to actions (with HTML or JS)
